AUX Session: Boss Battle System Design
Session Type: planning
Date: 2025-11-26

Context:
- MVG (Phase 2.5) completed: Player controls, Enemy spawning, Collision detection, HUD, GameOver
- Growth system (Phase 3) planned: Level 3 upgrades require Boss Cores
- Current enemy specs: HP 1, straight + sway movement, 10 damage on collision

Task:
Create comprehensive boss battle system design document with:
1. Boss specifications (HP, movement, appearance)
2. Attack patterns (3-5 types per boss)
3. Weakness system (optional)
4. Boss battle flow
5. Implementation priority (Phase 4.1-4.3)
6. Game balance analysis

Inputs reviewed:
- /Users/haya/副業/shooting2/3d-shooting-game/docs/por/POR.md
- /Users/haya/副業/shooting2/3d-shooting-game/src/core/Enemy.ts
- /Users/haya/副業/shooting2/3d-shooting-game/src/core/Player.ts
- /Users/haya/副業/shooting2/3d-shooting-game/src/data/partsData.ts
- /Users/haya/副業/shooting2/3d-shooting-game/src/core/Game.ts

Output:
- boss-system-design.md (comprehensive design document in Japanese)

Key Decisions:
1. Three boss types: Early (HP 50), Mid (HP 120), Final (HP 250)
2. Boss Core rewards: 1, 2, 3 respectively
3. Spawn triggers: 20, 50, 100 enemy kills
4. Attack patterns: 3, 4, 5 types respectively
5. Weakness system deferred to Phase 4.3 (optional)
6. Progressive difficulty: Lv.0 can beat first boss, Lv.1-2 for mid boss, Lv.3 for final boss
7. Implementation phases: 4.1 (minimal boss), 4.2 (attack patterns), 4.3 (all bosses + advanced systems)

Next Steps:
- PeerB to review design document before Phase 4.1 implementation
- Update POR.md to mark "Boss attack pattern design" delegation as complete
- Begin Phase 4.1 implementation after Phase 3 completion
